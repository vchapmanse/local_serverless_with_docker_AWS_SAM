About the Event
AWS Community Day | Midwest is an annual one-day, user-run AWS technical conference that is planned, organized, and delivered by AWS user group community leaders (much like a “Meetup of Meetups”). The goal of the Community Day is to facilitate the exchange of information amongst the AWS user community. The presentations are all given by speakers who are fellow AWS users sharing knowledge with their peers.

In light of the current situation, we have decided to make the AWS Community Day | Midwest 2020 a virtual event. We hope you can join us to create a unique and valuable experience together!
